            <div class="title">About the App</div>
            <div class="desc">
                NSWeXplorer Data API is the data interface used by <a href="http://apps4nsw.uservoice.com/forums/35904-apps/suggestions/584295-nswexplorer?ref=title" title="NSWeXplorer">NSWeXplorer</a> for
                <a href="http://www.information.nsw.gov.au/apps4nsw/about" title="Apps4NSW">Apps4NSW</a> contest.
                The API has implemented by <a href="#" class="p_name">Mingyi Wang</a> and <a href="#" class="p_name">Zifei Gong</a>.
                <p/>
                The application integrates lots of datasets such as attractions, services and acitivities
                information and having the ability to interact with further datasets. It converts the raw data from different data sources with different format
                into a json responce which contains geographic information and other details for different kinds of facilities in NSW state.
                It also exposes the interface by returning a WSDL file, which allows developers to further consume the service.
                Our other application <a href="http://apps4nsw.uservoice.com/forums/35904-apps/suggestions/584295-nswexplorer?ref=title" title="NSWeXplorer">NSWeXplorer</a> can be seen as a prototype for the usage of this API.

            <div class="title">Why the App</div>
            <div class="desc">
                The main purpose of having this API is to help developer who has great ideas to overcome
                the problem of integrate different data sources, which usually the biggest time consuming phase when making a mashup.
                By using the API, it should easier the development and allows people do consentrate on their ideas and business logic
                instead of spending too much time on data layer.

                Some data are fetched from web pages, we use them just for an demonstration purpose for our idea,

            <div class="title">The challenges we faced</div>
            <div class="desc">
                The biggest challange we faced was integrating different format of data.
                The data are from Government departments, Local councils and web pages.
                Most of them was in Excel documents and a few of them are XML files, the rest are displayed on web pages.
                Those data are strctured for human reading but not for computer understanding.
                So having a unified interface which has the ability to integrate them as well as further datasets is important and can save huge time in future development.
                <p/>
                Besides the data format, we also faced a problem which is there are actually a quite 
                limited range of data available for implement our whole idea. Some data we found has not including NSW states as well.
                Although there're quite a few statistic datasets which can be obtained from <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/CDATAOnline" title="Australian Bureau of Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>,
                we are not satisfied just implement another mashup which only shows statistics like Crime rate, population, etc,
                since there're already something like that, e.g. <a href="http://www.hackdays.com/knowwhereyoulive/" title="Know Where You Live">Know Where You Live</a>,
                <a href="http://www.suburbantrends.com.au/" title="Suburban Trends">Suburban Trends</a>.
                However NSWeXplorer is just a prototype for our idea, and all rights of the data belongs to its data provider.
                <p/>
                Finding a stable host is also a little bit time consuming. Since we are using J2EE technology, 
                which we though more flexible and powerful then PHP, find a cheap and reliable hosting needs a little bit more work.
                We are currently hosting our mashup on <a href="stax.net" title="Stax">Stax.net</a>, which is an Cloudy platform based on Amazon EC2.
                Currently the site can not afford very high traffic or requests, and there are might be some server downtime for maintainance.
